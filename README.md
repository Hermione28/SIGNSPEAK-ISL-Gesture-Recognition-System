# SignSpeak – ISL Gesture Recognition System 



## **Description**

This project aims to detect and recognize Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using **Mediapipe**, **OpenCV**, and **Machine Learning**. The system extracts hand landmarks in real time and classifies them using a trained neural network. The repository includes code for dataset preprocessing, keypoint extraction, model training, and real-time ISL gesture prediction.

## **How It Works**

The system uses **Mediapipe Hands** to detect hand and finger landmarks from webcam input in real time. These extracted **42 keypoints** are fed into a trained **feedforward neural network (FNN)**, which predicts the ISL gesture class.

**Workflow:**

1. Webcam captures a live video frame.
2. Mediapipe detects the hand and extracts 21 keypoints per hand.
3. Extracted coordinates are normalized and passed to the trained classifier.
4. The model predicts the gesture class.
5. The predicted result is displayed on the video stream in real time.
