# SIGNSPEAK-ISL-Gesture-Recognition-System
Indian Sign Language Detection using MediaPipe &amp; Deep Learning. This project detects ISL hand gestures in real-time using OpenCV and a trained TensorFlow model. Keypoints are extracted via MediaPipe and fed into a classifier for gesture prediction. Useful for accessibility, learning and sign language communication systems.
